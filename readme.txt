Modification to the category and post template logic to behave like pages (selectable through admin)

== Description ==

This plugin makes category templates be selectable by drop-down list from the manage > categories screen of the admin console. It makes the selection / use of category and post templates as easy as page templates. It also includes configuration options that allow you to configure whether sub-categories inherit templates from their parent if none are specified.

Features: 

* You can now use one category template for multiple categories without identical copies of the category-##.php

* All category / post templates and settings are relative to the current theme applied to Wordpress

* If you select a different theme, the entries will remain in the database in case you want to revert back.

* If you delete a category, all records (regardless of theme / version) will be deleted.

* The Sub-Category Inheritance option applies for both category templates and post templates.

* Now supports parent / child theme configurations.

= This plugin is great for modifying the front-end of categories / posts, but what about the admin console?
